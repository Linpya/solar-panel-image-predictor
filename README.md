# solar-panel-image-predictor
This code builds an image classification model to detect whether solar panels are clean or dusty using VGG16 transfer learning. It preprocesses and augments images, splits data into train/test/validation sets, and trains a neural network with class balancing. The model is then evaluated and saved for future use.
